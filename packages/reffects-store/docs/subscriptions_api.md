# Subscribing React components to changes in store's state

## React components

You need have to ways to subscribe a component to the state:

1. [subscribe](#subscribe)
2. [useSelector](#useSelector)

### `subscribe`
This function subscribes a React component to given [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)'s selectors, so that it only renders when the values in the application state tracked by the given selectors change.

The `subscribe` function gets as first parameter the component we want to subscribe to to the store.

As second parameter receives one parameter, called `mapStateToProps`, which is a function that maps the application state to the properties of the component we want to subscribe.

Finally, the third parameter is an object of properties we can optionally pass to the subscribed component as options or additional properties. This is useful if we want to keep our component separated of any `reffects` function or any other side effect trigger and keep it only presentational.

The `subscribe` function returns a wrapped component that renders only when the values mapped by `mapStateToProps` function change.

We always use [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)â€™s selectors to write the `mapStateToProps` function because they give us memoization, composability and tools for testing out of the box. This allows us to avoid writing code to optimize rerenderings.

Example:

```js
import React from "react";
import { dispatch } from "packages/reffects/dist/reffects.es";
import { subscribe } from "packages/reffects-store/dist/reffects-store.es";

export function Counter({ count, onClickIncrement, onClickDecrement }) {
  return (
    <>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={onClickIncrement}>+</button>
      <button onClick={onClickDecrement}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}

// Example of a simple selector
function countSelector(state) {
  return state.count;
}

export default subscribe(
  Counter,
  function(state) {
    return {
      count: countSelector(state)
    };
  },
  {
    onClickIncrement: dispatch("INCREMENT_COUNTER"),
    onClickDecrement: dispatch("DECREMENT_COUNTER")
  }
);
```

### `useSelector`

This is a custom React hook that you can use in functional components 
that expect a selector function as argument. As the `subscribe` function
will force the render of the component when the subscribed part of the state changes.

Example:

```js
import React from "react";
import { dispatch } from "packages/reffects/dist/reffects.es";
import { useSelector } from "packages/reffects-store/dist/reffects-store.es";

export default function Counter({ 
    onClickIncrement = () => dispatch("INCREMENT_COUNTER"), 
    onClickDecrement = () => dispatch("DECREMENT_COUNTER")
}) {
  const count = useSelector(countSelector);

  return (
    <>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={onClickIncrement}>+</button>
      <button onClick={onClickDecrement}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}

// Example of a simple selector
function countSelector(state) {
  return state.count;
}
```

## Events

You can also dispatch events based on the state's changes.

### `subscribeEvent`

The `subscribeEvent` function subscribes an event id to given [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)'s selectors, so that events are only dispatched when the values in the application state tracked by the given selectors change.

It gets as first parameter the event id we want to subscribe to the store.

As second parameter, it receives a `mapStateToPayload` function which maps the application state to a payload that is compatible with the subscribed event id.

Keep in mind that events will be dispatched only if the result of `mapStateToPayload` contains data that is not equivalent to data from previous mapped state.

The `subscribeEvent` function returns a callable that, when invoked, unsubscribes the event id. Meaning that it will stop dispatching events when the state changes.

Example:

```js
import { dispatch } from "packages/reffects/dist/reffects.es";
import { subscribeEvent, state } from "packages/reffects-store/dist/reffects-store.es";

// An event that checks if the player won
registerEventHandler('CHECK_VICTORY', function checkVictory(_, counter) {
  if (counter === 100) {
    return state.set({'game.youWon': true});
  } else {
    return state.set({'game.youWon': undefined})
  }
});

// Example of a simple selector
function countSelector(state) {
  return state.count;
}

export default subscribeEvent(
  'CHECK_VICTORY',
  function(state) {
    return countSelector(state);
  }
);

dispatch('INCREMENT_COUNTER');

```
